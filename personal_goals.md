## Personal goals - Open Source Workshop
 ##### Joshua Herskowitz

Some of the personal goals i have set for myself in this course.

 - I would like understand and learn how large software projects are developed without a central authority. I know this isn't always the case for OSS, but it certainly seems like a characteristic. Distributed, and especially democratic planning and decision making is a field I am very curious and excited about, but not very knowledgeable of.
	 - As a smaller side-goal, It would be very cool to learn how to get up to speed quickly in the midst of a project already under development, and start contributing effectively.

 -  Actually be involved in the planning, development and management of a software project from start to finish. In the different university courses, I feel that often I am always either planning, or developing a small scale application. Whereas at work, as a student intern, I feel that I am mostly taking part in the management of software. I want to have a more holistic view of the process, in a way which i hope will integrate and refine the insights gained from working on theses different aspects separately.

 - As so far an exclusively backend developer, I would like to learn GUI and frontend frameworks, languages, and best practices to enable myself to create applications that are functional and accessible to their target audience. Especially since I would like to work in educational software someday, designing the interface and user experience are often more central to creating a viable project than the specifics of the backend code.
