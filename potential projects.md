# Potential Projects

 - **Local exploration App**
	 - A local social app where people can share (anonymously or otherwise) personal histories attached to specific locations. Ranging from historical tidbits and recommendations to personal stories about life events or emotions connected to this location.
	 - Users can become tourists in familiar locations, viewing the world through other's eyes, as well as a more intimate peak into
	 - main interface is a map of local stories.
		 - Maybe only the immediate surroundings can be seen?
 - **Commuter racing game.**
	 - We always wonder which route / bus / time gives us the ideal commute. Current planning tools often miss out on schedule changes, estimated vs actual times, and delay.
	 - Anonymously race against people with a similar commute on a regular basis, to see which route is better.
	 - Allow comparison by other parameters as well.
