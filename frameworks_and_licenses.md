## Tools and Frameworks

 - **Rust**
	 - **What**:  Up and coming compiled language.
	 - 	**Why**:  I've heard many good things and am very interested to learn the language.
	 - **License**: MIT + Apache
	 - **Compatible**: Yes. Since they are both very permissive, there is not much concern when using Rust in our project.
 - **Crystal + Amber**
	 - **What**:  Very new compiled language with ruby-like syntax and inferred typing.
	 - 	**Why**:  I enjoy the straightforward syntax of ruby and other loosely-typed scripting language. It is very seductive to be able to enjoy these while retaining the performance of a compiled language.
	 - **License**: Apache
	 - **Compatible**: As above.
 - **React**
	 - **What**: FE framework developed by facebook.
	 - 	**Why**:  Often surveyed as the most-loved framework nowadays, and in fairly high demand recently in Israel.
	 - **License**: MIT since 2017
	 - **Compatible**:  As above.

### Personal note
I have to say it was disappointing to realize that such a plurality of software infrastructures i am familiar with all avoid leaning toward copyleft licenses.

I of course understand that since large for-profit software enterprises have an extreme effect on the growth of a framework, it makes sense that they will avoid copyleft frameworks like the plague.

Nevertheless, I suppose I underestimated the effect this factor would have.
